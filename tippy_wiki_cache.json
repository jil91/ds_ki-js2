Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.</p><blockquote class=\"templatequote \"><p>The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement.
